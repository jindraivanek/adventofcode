## Motivation
- lot of problems are grid based
- visual representation help to identify the bug

## Godot
- multiplatform game engine, targets Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android and Web (via WASM)
- main scripting language GDScript similar to Python
- first class .NET/C# support for scripting
- F# support not so first class, but we can workaround it :)
